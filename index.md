What we strive to do.

### Make hard things easy
Use clear, familiar and approachable patterns and enable people to use the full power of their data.

### Keep it clear
Your data should be easy to parse, easy to understand, and easy to analyze. Regardless of the amount of abilities and functionality we provide, if it isn't clear â€” it isn't good.

## Design Decision Methods
How we make product design decision for Petran.

### Define design requirements
Clearly state the problem and conditions to define design requirements with colleagues and stakeholders. Use customer feedback and their stories when they're available. Answer what's most important first, then secondary and edge cases after that.

### Support decisions with evidence
Create objective measurements when possible. Use customer feedback, usability studies, and usage analytics to inform your design decisions. Don't assume best practices are true in your scenario.

### Explore and experiment
There's still room to better understand information. Explore and experiment to discover new ways of looking at data. We may find better and more valuable solutions by not resting on our laurels or assuming we have answers with existing solution by default immediately.
